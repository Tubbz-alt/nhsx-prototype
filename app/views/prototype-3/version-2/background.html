            <p>The digital transformation of the NHS is the most important change we will make to the healthcare system for the next decade. It will:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>improve patient care by giving NHS staff the tools they need to do their job more effectively and freeing up their time</li>
                <li>deliver digital services designed around the needs of patients and staff</li>
                <li>free up resources for other changes, from joining up health and social care to using data to boost cancer survival rates</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To do this, we need a transformation in the way that technology is led in the NHS. Responsibility for technology, digital and data policy is currently split across lots of organisations and teams. NHSX brings together a joint unit between the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and NHS Improvement to drive the transformation and lead policy, implementation and change.</p>
                <p>NHSX is a diverse team committed to transforming the NHS.  It brings together all the skills and expertise we need, including clinicians, technologists, policy experts, developers, data scientists and project managers.</p>
                <p>It will report directly to the Secretary of State and the Chief Executives of NHS England and NHS Improvement. It will be funded through existing budgets, transfers of staff and savings from NHS Digital, which is currently restructuring.</p>
